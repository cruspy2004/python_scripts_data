    "\n",
    "2. **Spatial Separation**: The two leaders are positioned on opposite sides of the network! This is really interesting because the layout algorithm naturally pulled them apart based on their connection patterns. This spatial distance probably reflects the social tension between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Different Types of Members**: \n",
    "   - Node 33 is both large and has a hot color - he's popular AND acts as a bridge\n",
    "   - Some nodes like 3 and 2 are fairly large (popular) but have cooler colors (lower betweenness). These members are probably well-connected within their own group but don't bridge to the other side. They're \"group loyalists\" rather than intermediaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conflict Indicators**: The visualization shows two competing centers of influence that are spatially and socially separated. The limited number of warm-colored nodes between them suggests few people were bridging the divide - a recipe for conflict."

    "**Comparison with Baseline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When I compare this colored version with my baseline from Task A, the algorithm has successfully identified the two clusters I could see visually. The blue and salmon colors now make the division explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boundary Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the edges between the colored groups, there are relatively few connections crossing the boundary compared to connections within each group. Based on my calculation above, only about 15-20% of edges cross between communities. This suggests the club was already structurally divided before the actual split happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weak connections between groups explain why the split was possible - there weren't many \"bridge\" friendships holding the two sides together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical Alignment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm correctly places the two leaders (Nodes 0 and 33) in opposite communities, which matches the historical reality. This is impressive - the algorithm predicted the split just from the network structure!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Surprising Placements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some members who are physically close to one leader in the layout are actually assigned to the other community. For example, looking at the visualization, some nodes near Node 0 are colored salmon (Community 2). This happens because the algorithm looks at the overall pattern of connections, not just proximity to leaders. These members might have had a few connections to one leader but stronger overall ties to the other community.\n",

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Strength**: Easy to compare - bigger = more important\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Size differences can be hard to judge precisely\n",
    "- **Best use**: When you want to show influence or popularity at a glance\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Color Encoding (Betweenness/Communities):**\n",
    "- **Strength**: Can show a continuous range of values (like betweenness) or categories (like communities)\n",
    "- **Strength**: Works well with many nodes without cluttering\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Need to be careful with color choice for colorblind accessibility\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Sequential colormaps (like YlOrRd) only work for ordered data\n",
    "- **Best use**: Communities (categorical) or centrality measures (continuous)\n",

    "- **Strength**: Creates clear visual hierarchy\n",
    "- **Strength**: Doesn't interfere with other encodings (size/color)\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Only works for small numbers of categories (2-3 shapes max)\n",
    "- **Best use**: Highlighting special nodes or node types\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining multiple visual encodings (size + color + shape) is powerful but needs to be done carefully. Each encoding should communicate one clear dimension of the data. In this lab:\n",
    "- Size = popularity\n",

    "- Shape = role (leader vs member)\n",
